# Tmux

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer; it allows you to create several "pseudo terminals" from a single terminal. This is very useful for running multiple programs with a single connection, such as when you're remotely connecting to 
a machine using Secure Shell (SSH).

- Fully customizable status bar
- Multiple window management
- Splitting window in several panes
- Automatic layouts
- Panel synchronization
- Scriptability, which allows me to create custom tmux sessions for different purposes

## Get started with tmux
To start using tmux, type tmux on your terminal. This command launches a tmux server, creates a default session (number 0) with a single window, and attaches to it.

```
tmux
```
####  prefix key :Cntl+B
By default, the prefix is Ctrl+B. After that, press D to detach from the current session.

- You can detach from your tmux session by pressing  `prefix  d`
